	abstract = {An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best ﬁxed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efﬁciency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is signiﬁcantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

	abstract = {Recently Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has led to a tremendous surge in many domains of science and engineering. In this study, we present the advantage of DWT to improve time series forecasting precision. This article suggests a novel technique of forecasting by segregating a time series dataset into linear and nonlinear components through DWT. At first, DWT is used to decompose the in-sample training dataset of the time series into linear (detailed) and non-linear (approximate) parts. Then, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are used to separately recognize and predict the reconstructed detailed and approximate components, respectively. In this manner, the proposed approach tactically utilizes the unique strengths of DWT, ARIMA, and ANN to improve the forecasting accuracy. Our hybrid method is tested on four real-world time series and its forecasting results are compared with those of ARIMA, ANN, and Zhang's hybrid models. Results clearly show that the proposed method achieves best forecasting accuracies for each series.},

	abstract = {Medical imaging techniques have widely been in use in the diagnosis and detection of breast cancer. The drawback of applying these techniques is the large time consumption in the manual diagnosis of each image pattern by a professional radiologist. Automated classifiers could substantially upgrade the diagnosis process, in terms of both accuracy and time requirement by distinguishing benign and malignant patterns automatically. Neural network (NN) plays an important role in this respect, especially in the application of breast cancer detection. Despite the large number of publications that describe the utilization of NN in various medical techniques, only a few reviews are available that guide the development of these algorithms to enhance the detection techniques with respect to specificity and sensitivity. The purpose of this review is to analyze the contents of recently published literature with special attention to techniques and states of the art of NN in medical imaging. We discuss the usage of NN in four different medical imaging applications to show that NN is not restricted to few areas of medicine. Types of NN used, along with the various types of feeding data, have been reviewed. We also address hybrid NN adaptation in breast cancer detection.},
